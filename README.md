## About The Project
<p>Instead of tutorial CRUD YouTube projects that most of juniors do and use the "copy paste" method, I decided to work on a field that I know very well and like as a hobby.</p>

### Why I built this project
<p>As a gamer, and as a person who is working with computer 24/7 since the age of 3, I decided to build a project about eSports. I created a website which provides data about games, tournaments, teams, players and even predict which team is going to win the match.</p>



### Tech Stack
<p>This is the list of all technologies I used to build this project. It includes all the frameworks and libraries applied to this project.</p>


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
